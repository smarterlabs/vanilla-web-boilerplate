# Vanilla Web Boilerplate

A very bare bones and unopinionated HTML/CSS/JS boilerplate.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Setup

`npm install`

## Usage

`npm run dev`

A live dev server will open up in your local browser. Edit the files in the `src` directory.

## What is this boilerplate for?

Typically this will get used to build small components for projects that have very specific legacy needs and can't make use of modern development libraries, or for projects with custom one-off development libraries that can be added to this boilerplate. This boilerplate intentionally does not include any testing libraries, front end frameworks, or preprocessing languages.
